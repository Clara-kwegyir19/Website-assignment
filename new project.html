        <h1><B><u>A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.</u> </B></h1>
        <p> My name is Kwegyir- Obeng Clara, and i was born on the 19th April,2007 in Agona Swedru. i grew up in a small town, where i developed a love for science. From an early age, i was fascinatd by technology, which later shaped my career aspirations.</p>
        <p>I attended Ghana National College, where i excelled in Maths and Physics. During my school years, I actively participated in clubs, which helped me develop important skills like teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. My teachers and mentors played a significant role in shaping my personality and encouraging me to pursue my dreams. </p>
        <br>
        <h6><I><B><u>FUN FACTS</u></B></I></h6>
        <p>Talking about fun stuffs and my hobbies, i love to indulge in many outdoor games to release some stress.<br>Beyond my career, i am passionate about reading and writing of novels. Whether its reading, writing, travelling, sports or even playing an instrument(which i hardly do), i find joy in engaging in activities since it helps me to escape from reality. I also believe in giving back to the society and actively participate in community service.</p><br>
       <div><h5><p><U>CURRENT EDUCATIONAL PURSUIT.</U></p></h5> 
       <P>Currently, I am a student of the <b>KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</b>,offering a program I've always dreamt of. Deals concerning the topic "<b><u>COMPUTERS</u></b>"", always have dubious ways of sneaking into my heart. At a tender age where my dreams of becoming a lawyer was shattered, I had to find a different program. And there and then, was when i fell incredibly for technology and its entails.So upon reaching SHS three where I was a science student with ICT as a major elective, I was in a dilema on choosing a better program to secure my future and my love to technlogy.</P><br>
       After a lot of consulations, I finally decided to offer <I><B>COMPUTER ENGINEERING </B></I>over Computer Science. One might conclde that it's because I loved the I.T but I have way more reasons for this initiative than peolple.<B>WANNA KNOW?</B>
        <p>Computer engineers play a crucial role in modern society, as they bridge the gap between hardware and software to create advanced computing systems. Therefore my main reason for choosing computer engineering is to contribute to artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation, shaping the future of industries like healthcare, finance and manufacturing. This surfaced when my desire for technology grew tremendously into  passion. So looking into a field of computer which engulfs this idea, I came accross COMPUTER ENGINEERING and so i had nothing to do but to adopt it.</p></div>
